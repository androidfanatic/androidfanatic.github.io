I solve problems and translate them into beautiful solutions using one of many programming languages. 

I got fascinated with programming, the very first time I created WAP pages with DHTML and CSS 1.0, back in 2009, for a ringtone download site meant to work over 1.5 or 2G networks with browsers like Opera mobile and UCWeb. From 2010 to 2012, I co-owned, developed and moderated a popular disucssion board and downloads site (love4m.org) powered by PHP and MySQL.

Hobbies and interests:

When I'm not solving problems or mashing keys, I enjoy hiking, camping and macro photography.
