I enjoy solving all kinds of problems using one of many programming languages. Got fascinated with programming back in 2008-09 while building download sites meant to work over 2G networks. From 2010 to 2012, I developed, co-owned and moderated a popular forum and downloads site powered by PHP and MySQL. I got into computer engineering in 2012 and graduated in 2016. I've been working as a software engineer since then, taking up multiple roles and responsibilities as a fullstack developer.

My current toolset includes some python for data processing, React and Vue.js for UI and JavaScript for the rest. 

When I'm not staring at screens or mashing keys, I enjoy hiking, camping, photography and some occasional blogging.
