         <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy solving all kinds of problems using one of many programming languages. Got fascinated with programming back in 2008-09 while building download sites meant to work over 2G networks. From 2010 to 2012, I developed, co-owned and moderated a popular forum and downloads site powered by PHP and MySQL. I got into computer engineering in 2012 and graduated in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer since then, taking up multiple roles and responsibilities as a fullstack developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current toolset includes some python for data processing, React and Vue.js for UI and JavaScript for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not staring at screens or mashing keys, I enjoy hiking, camping, photography and some occasional blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
