<meta property="og:title" content="About" />
<meta property="og:description" content="I enjoy solving all kinds of problems using one of many programming languages. Got fascinated with programming back in 2008-09 while building download sites meant to work over 2G networks. From 2010 to 2012, I developed, co-owned and moderated a popular forum and downloads site powered by PHP and MySQL. I got into computer engineering in 2012 and graduated in 2016. I&rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer since then, taking up multiple roles and responsibilities as a fullstack developer." />

            <p>I enjoy solving all kinds of problems using one of many programming languages. Got fascinated with programming back in 2008-09 while building download sites meant to work over 2G networks. From 2010 to 2012, I developed, co-owned and moderated a popular forum and downloads site powered by PHP and MySQL. I got into computer engineering in 2012 and graduated in 2016. I&rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer since then, taking up multiple roles and responsibilities as a fullstack developer.</p>
<p>My current toolset includes some python for data processing, React and Vue.js for UI and JavaScript for the rest.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not staring at screens or mashing keys, I enjoy hiking, camping, photography and some occasional blogging.</p>
